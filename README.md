# GameOfLife

Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life!

# Rules

Each cell in the grid is either alive (black) or dead (white) and each 
cell follows these rules: 
1.Any alive cell with fewer than two alive neighbors dies.
2.Any alive cell with two or three alive neighbors remains alive.
3.Any alive cell with more than three alive neighbors dies.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three alive neighbors becomes alive.

# Controls

The red "cursor" cell represents the player object. You can control it 
using the arrow keys. Pressing P pauses the game and allows the player 
to change the state of the cells by pressing space bar.
